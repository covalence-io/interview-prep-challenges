# Challenges

[FizzBuzz](./FizzBuzz/index.js) You will be given an argument for a stopNum variable. You will create a for loop iterating from 1 to the stopNum, including the stopNum. You will be returning an array of integers and strings.

-   If the number is evenly divisble by 2, push "Cake" into the array.
-   If the number is evenly divisble by 5, push "Pie" into the array.
-   If the number is evenly divisble by BOTH 2 and 5, push "CakeAndPie" into the array.
-   Example return value - if stopNum is 10, the resulting output is:
-   `[1, "Cake", 3, "Cake", "Pie", "Cake", 7, "Cake", 9, "CakeAndPie"]`

[Is-Palindrome](./Is-Palindrome/index.js) will have you take a string, and see if the string is the same reversed as it is normally, returning `true` or `false`.

[Reverse-String](./Reverse-String/index.js) will give you a string, and have you return the reversed value.

[Summing-Array](./Summing-Array/index.js) will give you an array of positive integers only, and you must return the sum of all elements in the array.
